Umami allows you to pull data directly by calling the application's API endpoints.
Any operation you can do through the application is available in the API. All data is returned in JSON format.

### Self-hosting

When self-hosting, the API endpoints are available at `http://<your-umami-instance>/api`. You would first need
to [authenticate](/docs/api/authentication) before making calls.

### Umami Cloud

If using Umami Cloud, you would make calls to `https://api.umami.is/v1` using an [API key](/docs/cloud/api-key).
