# API

Umami allows you to pull data directly by calling the application's API endpoints.

If self-hosting, the API endpoints are available at `http://<your-umami-instance>/api`. You would first need
to [authenticate](/docs/api/authentication) before making calls.

If using Umami Cloud, you would make calls to `https://api.umami.is` using an [API key](/docs/cloud/api-key).

Any operation you can do through the application is available in the API. All data is returned as JSON.
