The Funnel report visualizes how users move through specific sequences of actions or pages on your website or product. At a glance, you can identify where users drop off in the process (whatever process you define!), so you can uncover opportunities for optimization and improve conversion rates. It’s perfect for founders/CEOs who need data quickly.

There are a near-infinite number of ways to set up and run a Funnel report in Umami, but we are going to review five ways to get the ideas flowing.

## Funnel Report Primer

Before diving into specific use cases, let's briefly cover how to use the Funnel report:

1. In your Umami dashboard, navigate to the Reports section and create a new Funnel report (the Funnel report comes standard with all versions of Umami).
2. Choose your desired website and date range for analysis.
3. Set the time window for funnel completion (how long users have to complete all steps).
4. Define your funnel steps using URLs, events, or URL wildcards (minimum of two steps required).
5. Run the report and analyze the results to understand user progression and drop-off points.

For maximum benefit, it's recommended to have custom events set up on your product or website. While you can create funnels using just URLs, custom events allow for a more granular and specific analysis of user actions.

Please refer to our documentation for detailed instructions on setting up and using the Funnel report.

Now, let's explore five ways startups can use the Funnel report in real-world scenarios to drive growth and make data-driven decisions.

## Optimizing User Onboarding

For startups, a smooth onboarding process is crucial for user activation and long-term retention. The Funnel report can help you identify and eliminate bottlenecks in your onboarding flow.

Create a funnel that tracks the key steps in your onboarding process, such as account creation, profile completion, and first key action (e.g., creating a project, sending a message, or making a purchase).

For example, you might discover a significant drop-off between account creation and profile completion. This could prompt you to simplify your profile setup process, add more engaging prompts, or implement a progress bar to encourage completion. By continually refining your onboarding funnel, you can improve user activation rates and set the stage for long-term engagement.

## Analyzing and Improving Conversion Paths

Because the Funnel report allows you to visualize each step of your conversion process and identify areas for improvement, you can create a funnel that represents your typical conversion path, from initial landing page visit through to final conversion action (e.g., sign-up, purchase, or subscription).

You might find that there's a drop-off between adding items to the cart and initiating checkout. This could let you know that you have issues with your pricing, shipping costs, or checkout process. Now you can focus on optimizing these specific areas, perhaps by offering free shipping thresholds, streamlining the checkout process, or adding trust signals to reduce abandonment.

## Feature Adoption Analysis

For product-led startups, understanding and improving feature adoption is key to user engagement and retention. The Funnel report can help you analyze how users discover and start using new features.

Create funnels for key features in your product, tracking steps from feature discovery (e.g., viewing a feature announcement or documentation) through to active usage.

You might see that many users view information about a new feature but few actually try it out. This could indicate that your feature explanation isn't clear enough, or that users don't immediately see the value. You could then focus on improving your feature introduction process, perhaps through interactive tutorials or more compelling use cases.

## Content Engagement Optimization

Creating content is a fundamental best practice for any startup, and the Funnel report can help optimize user engagement with your content, help you determine what content to write, and more.

Create funnels that track user progression through your content, such as from blog list page to individual article, to related articles, and finally to a call-to-action like newsletter signup or product page visit.

Analysis might reveal that users often read multiple articles but rarely progress to your product pages. This data could lead you to optimize your content strategy, perhaps by including more prominent or relevant calls-to-action within your articles, or by creating more product-focused content that bridges the gap between your blog and your core offering.

## User Segmentation and Personalization

The Funnel report can be a powerful tool for understanding how different user segments move through your product, informing personalization strategies.

Create multiple funnels for the same process but filter for different user segments (e.g., by acquisition source, user type, or geography). Compare these funnels to see how behavior differs across segments.

For instance, you might find that users from organic search have a much higher drop-off rate at the pricing page compared to users from referrals. This could indicate that your SEO is attracting users who aren't a great fit for your pricing or that users from referrals are better prepared for your pricing. You could use this data to better qualify organic traffic or to optimize your pricing page for different traffic sources.
