Umami allows you to create separate accounts so that you can host data for friends or clients.

Log into Umami as the administrator and click on **Settings** in the header.

The new account will have its own dashboard and websites separate from the **admin** account.

Only the **admin** is able to create, modify and delete accounts. The new account will not have access
to the **Accounts** tab.
