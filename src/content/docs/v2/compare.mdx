Choose a current date range and previous date range to compare against.

- **Previous period**: Same date range from the most recent past period.
- **Previous year**: Same date range last year.

Compare mode will show website stats along with performance changes between the two periods.
The graph will also display **Views** (Purple) and **Visitors** (Pink) lines from the previous period.
