Performance marketing can generally be thought of as a marketing approach that focuses on producing outcomes like acquisitions, conversions, signups, sales, etc, as well as analyzing data and making quick iterations. For Founder/ CEOs, effective performance marketing can be the difference between growth and stagnation. Umami Analytics offers reporting and functionality that can support your performance marketing function without the complexity or cost of enterprise-level tools.

## Setting Up Umami for Performance Marketing

Before diving into Umami's reports, it's important to set up your analytics correctly for effective performance marketing:

**Set up custom events for key performance indicators (KPIs):** Custom events are the backbone of granular tracking. Identify the most important user actions for your business – these could be sign-ups, purchases, feature activations, or any other critical interactions. Use Umami's tracking script to create custom events for each of these actions. For example, you might set up events like 'trial_signup', 'premium_purchase', or 'feature_x_activated'. These custom events will allow you to track user behavior in detail and measure the effectiveness of your marketing efforts.

**Implement UTM parameters in your campaign URLs:** UTM parameters are essential for attributing traffic and conversions to specific marketing campaigns. You can even use UTM links on your website and in your product for an even deeper understanding of usage. When creating URLs for your marketing campaigns (whether for ads, email marketing, social media posts, etc.), append UTM parameters to track source, medium, campaign name, and other relevant details. For instance, a URL might look like:

```text
https://umami.is/lp/demo-link?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=website_analytics
```

Umami automatically detects and categorize these parameters, allowing you to analyze campaign performance with precision. We will be discussing UTMs more when we get to the UTM report just below.

These two setup steps will help you lay a strong foundation for executing your performance marketing function with Umami.

## Using Umami's Reports for Performance Marketing

### UTM Report

The UTM report offers a view of how your marketing campaigns are performing. This report breaks down your traffic and engagement metrics based on the UTM parameters you've set up, allowing you to see which sources, mediums, campaigns, and even specific content pieces are driving the most traffic to your site. Also, as mentioned above, you can use UTM links on your website or in product, it is not just a tactic for marketing.

**Performance Marketing Strategy:** Start by comparing the traffic volume from different sources and campaigns and cross-reference this data with your conversion metrics from the Goals report (which we will get to shortly). You might find that while one campaign drives high traffic volume, another with lower traffic actually results in more conversions or higher-value customers.

Use these insights to refine your marketing mix. For instance, if you notice that your LinkedIn campaigns are driving fewer but higher-quality leads than your Facebook campaigns, you might decide to reallocate budget from Facebook to LinkedIn. Or, you might dig deeper into what's working well on LinkedIn and try to apply those learnings to improve your Facebook campaigns.

### Goals Report

The Goals report allows you to set up and track specific objectives, providing a view of how your marketing efforts are producing outcomes.

In the Goals report, you can define a goal for key conversion events such as sign-ups, purchases, or demo requests. You can track page views, events, and custom event data. For example, 1,000 signup events or 500 visits to the pricing page, etc.

**Performance Marketing Strategy:** Start by setting up goals for each stage of your conversion funnel – from initial engagement (like newsletter sign-ups) to final conversion (like purchases). This will give you a holistic view of how users are moving through your funnel.
Next, use the Goals report in conjunction with the UTM report to calculate the ROI for different marketing channels and campaigns. By assigning monetary values to your goals (which you can do using event data properties), you can see which marketing efforts are not just driving conversions, but actually contributing the most to your revenue.
Use these insights to continuously refine your marketing strategy. Double down on high-ROI channels and campaigns, and either optimize or phase out underperforming ones. Also, you can set up micro-goals to track smaller steps in the user journey to figure out where users are dropping off and where you can make improvements.

### Funnel Report

The Funnel report visualizes and analyzes specific conversion paths and shows you where users are dropping off in your conversion process.

When setting up the Funnel report, you can define each step using URLs, events, or even URL wildcards. This allows you to create just about any type of funnel, whether it's a simple sign-up process or a complex, multi-step purchasing journey.

**Performance Marketing Strategy:** The insights from the Funnel report can inform your conversion rate optimization (CRO) efforts, which most consider to fall under the performance marketing umbrella. Start by analyzing where the biggest drop-offs occur in your funnel. These are your prime targets for optimization.

For example, if you notice a significant drop-off between users adding items to their cart and initiating checkout, you might focus on strategies to reduce cart abandonment. This could involve implementing exit-intent popups with discount offers, simplifying the checkout process, or introducing trust signals earlier in the journey.

Use the Funnel report to A/B test different optimizations. Create separate funnels for different user segments or variations of your conversion path, and compare their performance. Regularly visit and refine your funnel definitions based on new features, changing user behavior, or shifts in your business model.

### Journey Report

The Journey report provides a visual map of how users navigate through your website or product. You can analyze user behavior without the need to pre-define the user path as is required in the funnel report. With the Journey report, you need to define the starting point and the ending point - which can be an event or page.

**Performance Marketing Strategy:** The insights from the Journey report can inform your content strategy, UX improvements, and even product development, all of which contribute to more effective performance marketing.

Start by analyzing the most common paths users take through your site. Are these aligned with the journeys you've designed, or are users finding unexpected routes? Use these insights to optimize your site structure and navigation. For instance, if you notice users often visit your pricing page directly after reading a specific blog post, you might add more prominent CTAs or pricing information to that post.

Pay attention to the paths of your most valuable users – those who convert or engage deeply with your product. What pages do they visit? What actions do they take? Use these insights to guide other users down similar paths. This might involve adjusting your internal linking strategy, creating guided tours, or personalizing user experiences based on behavior.

The Journey report is also excellent for identifying content gaps. If you notice users frequently moving from one page to another seemingly unrelated page, it might indicate that they're not finding the information they need. This could be an opportunity to create new content that better bridges this gap.

For performance marketing, use the Journey report to inform your ad targeting and content creation. If you notice that users who visit your feature comparison page are more likely to convert, you might create ads that link directly to this page, or create more top-of-funnel content that naturally leads users to the comparison page.

**Pro Tip:** The Journey report allows you to just define the ending point, and you can leave the starting point undefined. For example, if you want to see how users wind up on your pricing page, but not sure how or where they might be starting from, just leave that Start Step field blank when building your Journey report.
Lastly, use the Journey report to identify and minimize friction points. If you notice a page or step where many users exit your site, investigate why this might be happening and test improvements to keep users engaged.

### Retention Report

The Retention report measures user stickiness and long-term engagement. It provides a cohort analysis of how often users return to your site over time.

The report breaks down user retention on a daily basis, showing you how many users from each daily cohort return to your site on subsequent days. This view allows you to identify patterns in user behavior and measure the effectiveness of your retention strategies.

**Performance Marketing Strategy:** While many performance marketing efforts focus on acquisition, retention is equally crucial for growth. The Retention report helps you shift some of that focus to keeping and engaging the users you've already acquired.

Start by analyzing your baseline retention rates. Look for patterns – do you see a significant drop-off after a certain number of days? This could indicate a point in the user journey where you need to focus your retention efforts.

Use the Retention report to measure the impact of your onboarding process. Compare retention rates before and after implementing changes to your onboarding flow. An effective onboarding should lead to improved early-stage retention.

For performance marketing, use retention data to inform your retargeting campaigns. Identify the time periods where users are most likely to churn, and set up campaigns to re-engage these users just before these critical points. For example, if you notice a significant drop in retention after 14 days, you might set up an email campaign or retargeting ads that go out at day 12 or 13.

The Retention report is also valuable for measuring the long-term impact of your various marketing channels. Combine it with UTM data to see which channels not only drive initial conversions, but also result in users who stick around longer. This can help you focus your acquisition efforts on channels that drive high-lifetime-value customers.

Lastly, use retention data to inform your product development. If you notice retention improving after launching a new feature, it's a strong signal that this feature is driving user engagement. Conversely, if retention drops after a change, it might indicate that the change is not resonating with users.

### Insights Report

The Insights report allows you to segment your data using a variety of fields, apply advanced filters, and analyze key metrics like visitors, views, bounce rate, and visit duration.

With the Insights report, you can segment your data by URL, page title, referrer, device type, country, and more. You can also apply multiple filters to focus on very specific subsets of your data.

**Performance Marketing Strategy:** Use the segmentation features to understand how different user groups interact with your site. For example, you might compare the behavior of users from different countries, or users arriving from different referral sources. These insights can help you tailor your marketing messages and targeting for different segments.

Use the bounce rate and visit duration metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of your landing pages. High bounce rates or low visit durations might indicate that your page content isn't matching user expectations from your ads or other marketing messages.

The Insights report is also excellent for identifying high-performing content. Look for pages with low bounce rates and high visit durations – these are your engagement winners. Consider promoting this content more heavily in your marketing efforts, or analyze what makes this content successful and apply those learnings to other pages.

For e-commerce businesses, use the Insights report to identify products or categories that are popular with specific user segments. This can inform your cross-selling strategies and help you create more targeted marketing campaigns.

Lastly, use the Insights report to keep an eye on emerging trends. By regularly analyzing your data, you might spot shifts in user behavior or preferences early, allowing you to adjust your marketing strategy proactively.

## Let’s Get Real-time

One of Umami's strengths is its ability to provide real-time data. What most founders/CEOs don’t know is that Google Analytics can have a significant data lag, and real-time data is not guaranteed. Google’s official documentation says, “We may take 24-48 hours to process data. During that time, data in your reports may change.”

Real-time data from Umami allows you to monitor campaign performance as it happens, make quick adjustments to active campaigns, capitalize on trending topics or sudden spikes in traffic, and more. Use the real-time capabilities to stay agile in your marketing efforts, especially for time-sensitive campaigns or product launches.

## Final Thoughts

The key to successful performance marketing is continuous iteration based on data insights. Regularly review your reports, test new strategies, and optimize based on the results. Use the UTM report to refine your channel mix, the Goals report to focus on high-ROI activities, the Funnel and Journey reports to optimize your user paths, the Retention report to improve user stickiness, and the Insights report to uncover unique opportunities.
