# Enable Share URL

By default a website's metrics can only be seen by the account owner. But you can choose to make the stats avaiable either through a public **Share URL** or through a **Team**.

## Share URL

Log into Umami and click on **Settings** in the header.

The form that pops up will show you the URL.

You can generate a new unique share URL hash by clicking the **Regenerate** button and saving.
