Open source software has revolutionized the technology landscape, improving collaboration, innovation,
and giving everyone access to powerful tools. However, behind the scenes, running an open source company
presents a unique set of challenges that traditional software companies don't have to face.
Issues like maintaining a healthy developer community and searching for unique ways to monetize,
require special consideration and planning.

# Monetization

The largest hurdle for any open source company is monetization. How can a company make money when their product
is available to everyone for free?

A few options available to open source companies to generate revenue are:

- **Open Core Model** - Offering a basic open source version and a proprietary version with additional features and support.
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)** - Hosting the open source software as a service, providing customers with a cloud-based solution.
- **Dual-licensing** - Offering proprietary licenses for customers who want to use the software in a proprietary context,
  while still providing the open source version for community use.
- **Professional services** - Offering support, maintenance, and consulting services to customers who need help with
  implementation, customization, and troubleshooting.
- **Data and Analytics** - Collecting and analyzing data from open source software usage, and selling insights and
  analytics to customers.

# Community Management

Building and maintaining a healthy, active community of users and developers is essential for open source projects.
Since open source companies thrive on community engagement, they have to strike a delicate balance between managing the
community needs versus commercial interests. If a company restricts too much functionality of the software for commercial
purposes, this could cause a loss of community trust and involvement.
Therefore, decisions around feature prioritization, roadmap, and project direction have to be made carefully with the
needs of the community in mind.

# Competition

Open source companies operate in a competitive market, where proprietary software companies, being around much longer,
may have more resources to compete and retain market share. This is especially true if the open source company is trying to dethrone
an incumbent proprietary software company. Therefore, open source companies must differentiate themselves by either offering a superior user experience,
moving quickly with product development, or building an engaging community to help evangilize the software.

# Our Approach

At Umami, we are dedicated to open source development. Our main product, Umami Analytics, has its [source code](https://github.com/umami-software/umami)
available for anyone to download, build and run, completely for free.

For monetization, we decided to adopt the SaaS (Software as a Service) model.
We run a managed version of our application in the cloud, [Umami Cloud](https://cloud.umami.is?ref=umami-blog).
The advantage of using the cloud service over self-hosting is that all maintence, upgrades, data backups, and performance
scaling are all handled by us.

We decided not to pursue the other paths to monetization because they conflicted with our principles or goals.

**Open Core Model** - We didn't want to restrict functionality or gate certain features because we want to create the best product possible.
We want users to enjoy using it and find value from it without feeling restricted.

**Dual-licensing** - Most of our products are liberally licensed under the [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) license so that they
can be used as many people as possible so that they can then innovate further. We didn't want to limit the product in any way.

**Professional services** - We offer additional support services with our Enterprise plans, but we don't want to make it our primary
focus or source of revenue. The support is mainly to service our cloud product.

**Data and Analytics** - This was never an option for us. We respect and care about privacy so we would never get into the data business.

We strongly believe that open source is the future of software and want to travel that path despite the challenges.
