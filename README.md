## About 
Umami is a simple, easy to use, self-hosted web analytics solution. The goal is to provide you with a friendlier, privacy-focused alternative to Google Analytics and a free, open-sourced alternative to paid solutions. Umami collects only the metrics you care about and everything fits on a single page.

## Contributions

Would be happy to take contributions to improve the website. Help is needed especially in the [**Guides**](https://umami.is/docs/hosting) section.
If you know how to configure or deploy Umami in different environments, please share your knowledge.
