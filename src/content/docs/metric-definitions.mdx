## Calculated metrics

Calculated metrics are a combination of total and unique aggregates per website.

**Views**

The total number of events that were collected by your visitors.

**Visits**

Unique number of visits. A visit is a more granular range within a user session. A visit is calculated
using a hash of the session ID and rotating salt that is rotated at the start of every hour. Visits are able
to span across hourly intervals.

**Visitors**

Unique number of sessions. A session is calculated using a hash of data such as Website ID,
hostname, User-Agent, etc and a rotating salt that is rotated at the start of every month.

**Bounce rate**

A bounce is defined when a visit has only 1 event. A user will enter the website, initially generating a view, then leaving.
The bounce rate is calculated by dividing the total number of bounces by unique number of visits.

**Visit duration**

Total time spent on the website divided by unique number of visits. Total time is only calculated for visitors that
visit more than one page. The difference between the first and last event create time per visit are summed into a duration time.
