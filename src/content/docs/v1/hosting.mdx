There are many ways you can get Umami up and running.
All you need is a database (either [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/))
and server that can run [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (10.13 or newer).

## Single server

In this setup you would have the database and web server running on the same machine. You can optionally run Umami behind
a dedicated web server like [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) or [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) and proxy requests to Umami.

You can view the [Running on DigitalOcean](/docs/guides/running-on-digitalocean) guide to learn how to set up a server.

## Separate database and web server

In this setup you have a database running on its own machine that allows remote connections. Your web server is running on a different
machine with Umami installed and connects to the database remotely to store and retrieve data.

## App hosting

In this setup, you would have an app hosting provider host the Umami app for you. You would still need a database running elsewhere
that the app could connect to. Here are a few app hosting providers that can host Umami. Vercel, Netlify, and Railway both have a free tier available.

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Render](https://render.com/)
- [Railway](https://railway.app/)

For the deployment, the build command is `npm run build` and the publish directory is `.next`.

## Managed databases

A managed database is where the host provides you with a running database that you don't have to install or maintain. Here are some
providers for managed databases.
