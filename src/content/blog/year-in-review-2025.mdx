Over the past year, we spent a lot time building and improving Umami. It was a defining year
with lots of milestones. This post is a reflection on what we accomplished, what we learned from what we shipped,
and where we are headed next.

## What we built

We started 2025 with Umami v2.16.0 and ended with the release of the long awaited Umami v3.
With v3, we wanted to introduce a more streamlined experience with fewer screens to navigate, fewer clicks,
and easier access to data. You can read more about our changes in our [Umami v3](/blog/umami-v3) blog post.

At the end of 2025, we had made 13 official [releases](https://github.com/umami-software/umami/releases),
closed over 350 [issues](https://github.com/umami-software/umami/issues), and merged over 200 [PRs](https://github.com/umami-software/umami/pulls).
Many changes came from the community and the list of open source contributors keeps growing.

Additionally we made changes to [Umami Cloud](https://cloud.umami.is) to increase performance, reliability and security.
One significant change we made was to redesign our data collection system to be more fault tolerant so that we would
never lose data.

We have also completely revamped our [documention](https://umami.is/docs) to make it easier to read and navigate. We also split out
the legacy [v2 documention](https://v2.umami.is/docs) onto it's own separate site.

## What we learned

### Being an open source company is hard.

You need to balance the needs of the community along with the company.
But our approach has always been to create the best analytics product possible and have it accessible to as
many people as possible. Which is why we've never focused on gating certain features for Umami Cloud only. All the major features
we've released have been available for self-hosting.

### Listen to your users.

One of the greatest benefits of open source is that you are exposed to many different use cases that you may
not have discovered on your own. For example, users wanted more insights into revenue and channels,
or do additional checks before sending data, or send data in batches, or export their data in the UI.
These use cases were all community driven.

### Move fast, fix things

In late 2025, there was a very serious [React vulnerability](https://nextjs.org/blog/CVE-2025-66478) discovered that affected
many Next.js applications, like Umami. We quickly patched all our releases and secured our systems.

There were also a couple significant [outages](https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/) in 2025 from Cloudflare, one of the services we use.
This forced us to rethink our tech stack and to add additional resiliency to our systems.

## What's coming next

With the release of Umami v3, we now have a solid foundation for quickly adding new features. The next major feature is **Boards**, which will give users
the ability to customize the display of data however they like.

In 2026, we’re committed to continuing to build in the open.
If you’re using the product, contributing to the open source, or just following along, we thank you. Your feedback directly shapes what we build next.
