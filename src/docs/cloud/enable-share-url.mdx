# Enable share URL

By default a website's metrics can only be seen by the account owner. But you can choose to make the stats available either through a public **Share URL** or through a **Team**.

## Share URL

Navigate to **Websites** and click on the **Edit** button next to your website.

Navigate to the **Share URL** tab and toggle on the Share URL.

The form that pops up will show you the URL.

You can generate a new unique share URL hash by clicking the **Regenerate** button and saving.
