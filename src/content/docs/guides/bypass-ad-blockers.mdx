# Bypass ad blockers

Even though Umami is a privacy-focused product, it may still get blocked by
certain ad blockers. Ad blockers use blocklists maintained by many different people.
Some lists can be overly agressive, for example blocking anything with even
the word `analytics` in it or simply blocking all tracking products regardless
of how they operate.

Here are few methods you can use to avoid ad blockers.

## Proxying

You can proxy the tracking script itself to hide the actual name and location of
the original script.

For example, you can have a script on your website that is:

`https://your-website.com/script.js`

That is proxying the file at:

`https://analytics.umami.is/script.js`

So even if the ad blocker blocks the `analytics.umami.is` domain, your own domain would be safe.

Proxying is usually done at the server level. Here are some tutorials you can use:

- [Nginx](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/)
- [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/reverse_proxy.html)

If you are using a framework like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), you can use their [rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites) feature.

## Using environment variables (self-hosting)

If you are self-hosting Umami, you can configure your instance using [environment variables](/docs/environment-variables).

There are two sources that could potentially be blocked:

1. The tracker script at `https://your-umami.com/script.js`
2. The stats collection endpoint at `https://your-umami.com/api/send`.

The `TRACKER_SCRIPT_NAME` variable can be used to rename your tracker script to
something like `/x.js`. You would then change your script source to `https://your-umami.com/x.js`.

The `COLLECT_API_ENDPOINT` variable can be used to rename your endpoint to something
like `/api/x`. The tracker script will automatically make calls to your custom endpoint name
instead of `/api/send`.
