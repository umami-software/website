title: Installation
---

There are several different ways to install Umami.

- **Installing from source**: Get the code from [GitHub](https://github.com/umami-software/umami) and build the application yourself.
- **Using Docker compose**: Build your own Docker container using `docker compose`.
- **Using a Docker image**: Download a pre-built Docker image.

## Installing from source

### Requirements

- A server with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18.18 or newer.
- A database. Umami supports [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) (minimum v8.0) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (minimum v12.14) databases.

### Install Yarn

```shell
npm install -g yarn
```

### Get the source code and install packages

```shell
git init
git pull https://github.com/umami-software/umami.git
yarn
```

### Configure Umami

Create an `.env` file with the following:

```dotenv
# For MySQL/MariaDB
DATABASE_URL=mysql://username:mypassword@localhost:3306/mydb
# For PostgreSQL
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb
```

### Build the application

If you use MySQL/MariaDB, run this:
```shell
yarn prisma migrate resolve --applied "05_add_visit_id"
```

Building:
```shell
yarn build
```

The first time the build is run, it will create all the required database tables in your database.
It will also create a login account with username **admin** and password **umami**.

### Start the application

```shell
yarn start
```

By default this will launch the application on `http://localhost:3000`. You will need to either
[proxy](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/) requests from your web server
or change the [port](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/cli#production) to serve the application directly.

### Running Umami

You can simply run `yarn start` to start Umami, but it's highly recommended you use a process manager like [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) which will handle restarts for you.

To run with PM2:

```shell
yarn global add pm2
cd umami
pm2 start yarn --name umami -- start
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

## Installing with Docker

Umami ships with a docker compose that contains the application and a PostgreSQL database.

To build the Docker container and start up with a Postgres database, run:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

Alternatively, if you want to use prebuilt images, you can pull the Umami Docker image with PostgreSQL support:

```shell
docker pull docker.umami.is/umami-software/umami:postgresql-latest
```

Or with MySQL support:

```shell
docker pull docker.umami.is/umami-software/umami:mysql-latest
```
