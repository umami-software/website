# Environment variables

You can configure Umami with the use of environment variables. They go into the same `.env` file as your `DATABASE_URL`.

---

## Runtime variables

Runtime variables are recognized when Umami is running. You can set your environment variables prior to starting the application.

### DATABASE_URL = &lt;connection string&gt;

Connection string for your database. This is the only required variable.

### IGNORE_IP = &lt;ip addresses&gt;

You can provide a comma-delimited list of IP address to exclude from data collection.

### IGNORE_HOSTNAME = &lt;hostname&gt;

This will do a DNS lookup on a hostname and the resulting IP address will be ignored. This can be a comma delimited list of hostnames.

### FORCE_SSL = 1

This will redirect all requests from `http` to `https` in the Umami application. Note, this does not apply to the tracking script.

### LOG_QUERY = 1

If you are running in development mode, this will log database queries to the console for debugging.

### HOSTNAME = &lt;hostname&gt;
### PORT = &lt;port number&gt;

If you are running on an environment which requires you to bind to a specific hostname or port, such as Heroku, you can add
these variables and start your app with `npm run start-env` instead of `npm start`.

### CLIENT_IP_HEADER = &lt;header name&gt;

HTTP header to check for the client's IP address. This is useful when you're
behind a proxy that uses non-standard headers.

### REMOVE_TRAILING_SLASH = 1

Removes the trailing slash from all incoming urls.

### TRACKER_SCRIPT_NAME = &lt;script name&gt;

Allows you to assign a custom name to the tracker script different from the default `umami`. This is to help you avoid some ad-blockers.

Note: If you update this, be sure to update the tracking code on your website to the new name.

### COLLECT_API_ENDPOINT = /api/x

Allows you to send metrics to a location different than the default `/api/collect`. This is to help you avoid some ad-blockers.

### DISABLE_UPDATES = 1

Disables the check for new versions of Umami.

### DISABLE_LOGIN = 1

Disables the login page for the application.

### DISABLE_TELEMETRY = 1

Umami collects completely anonymous telemetry data in order help improve the application. You can choose to disable this if you don't want to participate.

---

## Build time variables

Build time variables are only recognized during the build process. This also includes building custom Docker images. You need to set your environment variables prior to building the application.

### BASE_PATH = &lt;path&gt;

If you want to host Umami under a subdirectory. You may need to update your reverse proxy settings to correctly handle the BASE_PATH prefix.


### DATABASE_TYPE = &lt;postgresql | mysql&gt;

The type of DB to be used. This is only required for the Docker build.
