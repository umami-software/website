Understanding the user journey is crucial for product teams and companies focused on product-led growth. Umami's new Journey report, which allows you to understand how users navigate your websites and web-based products, highlights a suite of customizable customer journey analytics reporting options that come out of the box.

The new Journey report is part of the latest version of Umami: [Umami v2.12.0](/blog/umami-v2.12.0).

# The New Journey Report

Umami's Journey report is a visualization tool that maps out users' paths as they interact with your website. This feature provides product teams with a detailed understanding of user behavior, allowing them to:

- Identify common navigation patterns
- Discover unexpected user flows
- Pinpoint areas of friction or drop-off

Of course, these use cases are just the tip of the iceberg. Whether you want to see all user paths or focus on specific pages or events, this report helps you identify areas for product improvement and optimize your website's performance.

The Journey report is fully customizable. You can build a report with any date range, between 3 and 7 steps, a starting step, and an ending step. As mentioned above, you can view the Journey report for pages, events, or a combination. There is no limit to the number of Journey reports you can build in your Umami dashboard, so you can have one for each key user flow you are trying to understand and optimize.

Since Umami works on your websites and web-based products, don't be surprised when the marketing folks ask for access to build their Journey reports. After all, Umami is designed to be a tool for all teams within your organization.

# Key Benefits for Product Teams

The Journey report is particularly valuable for optimizing critical paths within your product, such as onboarding sequences or conversion funnels. By visualizing these journeys, product teams can quickly identify bottlenecks and opportunities for improvement. Other potential use cases include:

- Feature adoption insights: Understand how users discover and engage with key features
- Onboarding optimization: Analyze and improve the new user experience
- Usability enhancement: Identify and address navigation issues or confusing user flows

# Complementary Reports in Umami's Customer Journey Analytics Suite

While the Journey report provides a comprehensive view of user navigation, Umami's Customer Journey Analytics capabilities extend beyond this single reporting feature. Umami's reporting suite includes several other reports that work in tandem to provide a holistic view of the customer journey:

## Retention Reports: Measure product stickiness and user return rates

Retention reports are crucial for understanding how well your product keeps users engaged over time. These reports allow product teams to:

- Track retention rates
- Identify factors contributing to user churn
- Measure the impact of new features or changes on user retention

## Funnel Reports: Analyze and Optimize Your Conversion Processes

Funnel reports focus on specific sequences of page views and events that lead to business outcomes, such as user sign-ups or purchases. These reports enable product teams to:

- Visualize conversion rates at each step of a process
- Identify drop-off points in critical user flows
- A/B test different funnel configurations

## Goals Reports: Track Progress Towards Specific Business Objectives

Goals reports allow product teams to set and monitor progress toward key performance indicators (KPIs). These reports help teams:

- Define and track specific product goals
- Measure the impact of product changes on goal completion rates
- Align product metrics with broader business objectives

# Integrating Journey with Other Reports

The power of Umami's Customer Journey Analytics suite lies in integrating insights from across these different reports. For example:

- Combine Journey report data with Retention report data to identify which paths lead to higher long-term engagement
- Use Funnel report data in conjunction with Journey report data to understand alternative paths users take when dropping out of a funnel
- Correlate data from the Goals report with Journey data to optimize paths that lead to key business outcomes

# Implementation and Best Practices

Implementing Umami's Customer Journey Analytics suite, including the Journey report, is straightforward for teams already using Umami. These reports come out of the box, providing immediate access to these powerful insights without complex setups.

To make the most of these tools, product teams should:

1. Define clear objectives for what they want to learn about user behavior
2. Regularly review and analyze data from all report types
3. Use insights to inform product decisions and measure the impact of changes

Umami's approach to Journey reporting, as part of its broader Customer Journey Analytics capabilities, offers product teams a customizable reporting toolkit for understanding and optimizing the customer experience. By combining the visual power of the Journey report with the focused insights of Retention, Funnel, and Goals reports, teams can gain a nuanced understanding of how customers navigate their products and websites.
