title: Authentication
---

The following authentication method is only for self-hosted Umami. For **Umami Cloud**, you simply
need to generate an [API key](/docs/cloud/api-key).

## POST /api/auth/login

First you need to get a _token_ in order to make API requests. You need to make a
`POST` request to the `/api/auth/login` endpoint with the following data:

```json
{
  "username": "your-username",
  "password": "your-password"
}
```

If successful you should get a response like the following:

```json
{
  "token": "api_eyTMjU2IiwiY...4Q0JDLUhWxnIjoiUE_A",
  "user": {
    "id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "username": "admin",
    "role": "admin",
    "createdAt": "2000-00-00T00:00:00.000Z",
    "isAdmin": true
  }
}
```

Save the token value and send an `Authorization` header with all your data requests with the value `Bearer <token>`. Your request header should look something like this:

```http request
Authorization: Bearer api_eyTMjU2IiwiY...4Q0JDLUhWxnIjoiUE_A
```

For example, with `curl` it would look like this:

```shell
curl https://{yourserver}/api/websites
   -H "Accept: application/json"
   -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

The authorization token is expected with every API call that requires permissions.

## POST /api/auth/verify

You can verify if the token is still valid.

**Sample response**

```json
{
  "id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "username": "admin",
  "role": "admin",
  "createdAt": "2000-00-00T00:00:00.000Z",
  "isAdmin": true,
  "teams": []
}
```
