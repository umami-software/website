# Running on Koyeb

[Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com) is a developer-friendly serverless platform to deploy apps globally. The platform lets you seamlessly run Docker containers, web apps, and APIs with git-based deployment, native autoscaling, free SSL, a global edge network, and built-in service mesh and discovery.

## Setup

In this guide, you need to have a PostgreSQL database server running and accepting remote connections. If you do not already have a database, you can check out the **Managed database** section under [Hosting](/docs/hosting).

>You will need to set up the database tables by following the **Create database tables** section of the [Install](/docs/install) docs.

To deploy Umami, we use the [Koyeb CLI](https://github.com/koyeb/koyeb-cli), you can also perform the setup using the [Koyeb control panel](https://app.koyeb.com).

### Create Koyeb Secrets

Create one Koyeb secrets to securely store your `DATABASE_URL`. In the terminal execute the following command:

```sh
$ koyeb secret create umami-database-url
Enter your secret: postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<db-name>?sslmode=require

$ openssl rand -hex 32 | koyeb secret create umami-hash-salt --value-from-stdin
```

### Deploy Umami

Once you’ve created the secrets, you can deploy Umami. In your terminal run the following command to create a new Koyeb App and deploy the Umami service:

```sh
koyeb app init umami --docker ghcr.io/umami-software/umami:postgresql-latest --ports 3000:http --routes /:3000 --env DATABASE_URL=@umami-database-url
```

Your Umami service is being deployed. To retrieve the Umami URL run:

```
$ koyeb app get umami
ID                                  	NAME     	DOMAINS                         	UPDATED AT
30de8301-05b1-4131-a842-28e608900000	umami   	umami-<YOUR_KOYEB_ORG>.koyeb.app	2021-07-06 11:58:01.143967 +0000 UTC
```

Open the URL to access Umami and follow the **Getting started** guide starting from the [Login](/docs/login) step.
