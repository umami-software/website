# Getting started with Umami

Umami is a self-hosted web analytics solution. There are many different ways to run Umami.

If you want to install directly from the source code or build your own docker images, you can jump directly to the [Install](/docs/install) section.

If you want pre-built docker images for your database, you can pull directly from our registry:

### PostgreSQL

```shell
docker pull docker.umami.is/umami-software/umami:postgresql-latest
```

### MySQL

```shell
docker pull docker.umami.is/umami-software/umami:mysql-latest
```

## Hosting

If you are unfamiliar with running your own servers, check out the [Hosting](/docs/hosting) section to get a quick overview.

There are also many services that will run Umami. See the **Guides** section in the navigation menu.
