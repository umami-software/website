This is the repository of the [Umami](https://umami.is) website built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## About 
Umami is a simple, easy to use, self-hosted web analytics solution. 
The goal is to provide you with a friendlier, privacy-focused alternative 
to Google Analytics and a free, open source alternative to paid solutions.
Umami collects only the metrics you care about and respects the privacy of your users.

# using npm
npm install

npm run dev
```
```shell
# using yarn
yarn

yarn dev
```

## Contributions

Would be happy to take contributions to improve the website. Help is needed especially in the [**Guides**](https://umami.is/docs/hosting) section.
If you know how to configure or deploy Umami in different environments, please share your knowledge.
