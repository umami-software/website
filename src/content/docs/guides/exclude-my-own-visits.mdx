# Exclude my own visits

You want to visit your own website, but you don't want your visits to appear in
your stats. To accomplish this, you need to add a setting to your browser.

Bring up the developer console in your browser: `Settings -> More tools -> Developer tools`

In the console, enter the following code and hit `Enter`:

```javascript
localStorage.setItem('umami.disabled', 1);
```

This setting applies **per website**, so you will need to do this for each website
you want to be excluded from.

To remove the setting, enter the following code and hit `Enter`:

```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('umami.disabled');
```
