# Track events

Besides pageviews, Umami is also able to track events that occur on your website. There are two ways to record
events in Umami, using **CSS classes** or using **JavaScript**.

## Using CSS classes

To enable events, simply add a
special CSS class to the element you want to track.

For example, you might have a button with the following code:

```html
<button id="signup-button" class="button">Sign up</button>
```

Add a class with the following format:

```
umami--<event>--<event-name>
```

So your button element would now look like this:

```html
<button id="signup-button" class="button umami--click--signup-button">Sign up</button>
```

When the user clicks on this button, Umami will record an event named `signup-button` with an event type of `click`.

The event can be any [JavaScript event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) that can be
applied to an element.

Note: be careful not to attach to any events that fire continuously like `scroll` and `drag`.

## Using JavaScript

You can also record events manually using the `window.umami` object. To accomplish the same thing as the above
CSS method, you can do:

```js
const button = document.getElementById('signup-button');

button.onclick = () => umami('Signup button click');
```

In this case, Umami will record an event named `Signup button click` with an event type of `custom`.

If you want to use your own event type instead of `custom`, see [Tracker functions](/docs/tracker-functions).

## View events

Once your events are recorded, they will be available on your website **Details** page.
