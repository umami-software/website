# Running on Vercel

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is the company behind the framework [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) which is used by Umami.
They also provide a free hosting service which is ideal for Next.js applications.

If you don't already have a database, you can create a Vercel Postgres database integration. You can also
follow the [Running on DigitalOcean](/docs/running-on-digitalocean) guide or the
[Running on PlanetScale](/docs/running-on-planetscale) guide to get a database up and running.
You can also check out the **Managed databases** section under [Hosting](/docs/hosting).

## Setup [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fumami-software%2Fumami&env=DATABASE_URL)

_Automate steps 1-5 using the button above_

1. Fork the [https://github.com/umami-software/umami](https://github.com/umami-software/umami) project to your GitHub account.
2. Create an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
3. From the dashboard page click **Import Project** then specify the URL to your fork of the project on GitHub.
4. Add the required environment variables `DATABASE_URL` to your Vercel project. These values are defined in the
   **Configure Umami** step from [Install](/docs/install). You can also create a Vercel Postgres database at this point.

- You should use `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL` for umami, which is in the form of `postgres://user:passwd@endpoint-pooler.postgres.vercel-storage.com/verceldb?pgbouncer=true&connect_timeout=10`.
- The environment variable used for the database URL can be changed in the `db/postgresql/prisma.schema` file.

5. Deploy and visit your application at `<deploy-id>.vercel.app`.
6. Follow the **Getting started** guide starting from the [Login](/docs/login) step and be sure to change the default password.

### Proxy Umami Analytics via Vercel

Optionally, you can proxy Umami Analytics to serve Umami Analytics from your main domain. This is also useful for bypassing ad-blocker when using [Umami Cloud](https://umami.is/pricing).

See Vercel's [rewrites docs](https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration).

In the root of your project, add the `vercel.json` file with the following contents:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/stats/:match*",
      "destination": "https://analytics.umami.is/:match*"
    }
  ]
}
```

The tracking code script tag should use `/stats/script.js` as `src` value:

```html
<script
  async
  defer
  src="/stats/script.js"
  data-website-id="94db1cb1-74f4-4a40-ad6c-962362670409"
></script>
```
