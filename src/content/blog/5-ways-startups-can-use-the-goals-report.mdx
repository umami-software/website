The Umami Goals report is a customizable report that lets you set, track, and visualize progress toward key objectives. By leveraging its capabilities, founders can gain quick insights into various aspects of their business, from user acquisition to product engagement and everything in between. We explore five real-world use cases demonstrating how startups can use the Umami Goals report.

## Quick Goals Report Primer

Before diving into specific use cases, let's briefly cover how to use the Umami Goals report effectively:

1. In your Umami dashboard, go to the Reports section and create a new Goals report (the Goals report comes standard with all versions of Umami).
2. Define your goals using URLs, custom events, or event data property.
3. Specify the target value for each goal and the date range for tracking (e.g., 100 sign-ups per week)
4. Run the report and analyze the results to gauge your progress.

For maximum benefit, it's recommended to set up custom event tracking. While you can still use the Goals report with just URLs, custom events allow for more granular and specific tracking of user actions.

For detailed instructions on setting up and using the Goals report, please refer to our [documentation](https://umami.is/docs/reports/report-goals) and our blog post titled [How to use the Goals Report to Drive Feature Usage, Adoption, and Conversions](https://umami.is/blog/how-to-use-the-goals-report).

Let's explore five ways startups can leverage the Goals report to drive growth and make data-driven decisions.

## User Acquisition

For startups, user acquisition is often the most critical metric for growth. The Goals report can help you set and monitor user acquisition targets effectively. Creating goals for new user signups lets you track your progress in real-time and quickly identify if your acquisition strategies are working.

Consider setting up goals for visits to your landing page, signup button clicks and completed signups. You can also create separate goals for different acquisition channels, such as campaign-specific landing pages or referral link clicks. This approach allows you to compare the performance of various channels and optimize your acquisition efforts accordingly.

For example, suppose you notice that your organic search traffic consistently meets its goals while your paid advertising is falling short. In that case, you might reallocate your budget toward SEO efforts. The visual nature of the Goals report makes it easy to spot these trends and make quick, informed decisions.

## New Feature Engagement

Launching new features is exciting, but knowing if users are actually using them is critical. The Goals report can provide insights into feature usage rates, helping you determine which features resonate with your users and guide your product roadmap.

Set goals to track feature discovery (e.g., views of feature documentation or tutorial pages) and feature usage (e.g., critical actions within the feature). Monitoring these metrics lets you quickly identify if a new feature is gaining traction or needs more promotion or improvement.

For instance, if you see high numbers for feature discovery but low usage rates, it might indicate that users are interested in the feature but need help to use it effectively. This insight could prompt you to improve your onboarding process or user interface for that specific feature.

## Conversions

Use the Goals report to target conversion actions, such as demo requests, free trial signups, or purchases.

By setting up goals for each step of your conversion funnel, you can quickly identify bottlenecks or areas that need improvement. For example, if you're meeting your goals for pricing page views but falling short on demo requests, you might need to optimize your pricing page or adjust your value proposition.

This data-driven approach allows you to make targeted improvements to your conversion funnel, potentially leading to significant increases in your overall conversion rate.

## Marketing Campaigns

The Goals report can help you measure the impact of your campaigns and optimize your marketing spend.

Set goals for campaign-specific landing page views, lead generation events (like webinar registrations or newsletter signups), and visits from specific marketing channels. Analyzing this data lets you quickly determine which campaigns and channels drive the most value for your startup.

For instance, if you notice that your content marketing efforts consistently outperform your paid advertising in lead generation, you might decide to allocate more resources to creating high-quality content. The Goals report makes it easy to visualize these trends and make data-driven marketing decisions.

## Product Engagement

Keeping users engaged with your product is crucial for long-term success. Use the Goals report to track key engagement metrics and identify potential issues before they impact your retention rates.

Set goals to monitor core feature usage, user activity levels, and onboarding completion rates. By visualizing these metrics, you can quickly identify drops in engagement and take proactive measures to keep your users active and satisfied.

For example, suppose you notice a decline in your daily active users goal. In that case, it might prompt you to investigate the cause, implement new engagement features, or improve your user onboarding process. Regularly monitoring these engagement metrics can help you maintain a healthy, growing user base.

## Getting Started

The Goals report is a customizable report that can provide startups with information to help decision making. Setting clear, measurable goals based on URLs and custom events allows you to create reports as nuanced as your product and user base.
