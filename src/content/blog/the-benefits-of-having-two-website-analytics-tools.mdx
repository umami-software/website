A reality of website analytics tools is that data inconsistencies, reporting delays, and even outages exist. All of these things can slow a company's ability to move fast.

In a world where seemingly every critical function operates with a backup, why is a two-website analytics solution a foreign concept? Why would we not want a backup and a second website data source to confirm the numbers we see or be available during an outage of the primary tool?

Executives love to ask questions like, "Are we sure this website analytics data is accurate?" and business operators love to reply with answers like, "This is the data I see in our website analytics system." It’s not really a good answer.

By running multiple website analytics tools simultaneously, you can increase confidence in the accuracy of your data and have a backup when your current system goes down. This approach empowers you to make better decisions based on multiple data points.

A better response to that executive question would be, "Our confidence in these numbers is high because multiple data sources show the same numbers."

## A Single-Tool Approach Is the Norm, Yet Doesn't Make Sense

We all love hearing parental "wisdom," so we might as well get this blog kicked off with some: never put all your eggs in one basket, they like to say. Putting all your eggs in one basket is tempting, especially when dealing with a ubiquitous and integrated-with-everything tool like Google Analytics. This blog post mentions Google Analytics and GA4, but we use those terms generically for website analytics because all website analytics tools can have similar issues.

First and foremost, no analytics tool is perfect. Let's pretend for a second that there are no [privacy concerns with GA4](/blog/umami-the-better-google-analytics-alternative); data discrepancies and inaccuracies can creep in due to factors such as ad blockers, browser settings, data lags, syncing errors, tracking script hiccups, etc. Relying on a single tool risks missing crucial data points or receiving a skewed representation of your website's performance.

Picture this: Google Analytics experiences an extended period of downtime or undergoes a major UI overhaul. You don't have to picture it; you probably remember your transition from Universal Analytics to GA4. Suddenly, you're left scrambling to make sense of your website's performance without your trusted data source. In a world where data is king, such a scenario can be crippling. Not having a backup puts you in an uncomfortable position where you have a gap in your data and have to explain why.

## The Multi-Tool Advantage

Running multiple website analytics tools, a primary and a backup, is smart. To be clear, I am not referring to a two-system approach like GA4 and a Hotjar or a CrazyEgg, where one tool has the numbers, and the other serves an entirely different use case. I am referring to running two tools that both report numbers.

A multi-tool approach allows you to cross-reference data for enhanced accuracy and confidence. You can spot discrepancies by comparing metrics across different platforms and ensure you're basing your decisions on double-confirmed data. This cross-referencing process can also unearth insights that might slip through the cracks when relying on a single tool.

You can increase your coverage by using the features and insights from multiple tools. One might excel at providing granular user behavior data, while another offers conversion funnel analysis. Combining these tools creates strong analytics coverage. Again, the idea is to use two website analytics tools that both run numbers.

But the benefits don't stop there. Running multiple analytics tools also serves as a safety net against data loss, tool failure, data lags, and more. If one tool hits a snag, you can fall back on the data from your other platforms to maintain continuity and keep making informed decisions. Having two website analytics tools seems logical, but isn’t the norm.

By comparing data from two different website analytics tools, you can confidently validate your findings and make sure you are making the right decisions.

## Choosing the Right Complementary Tool

When selecting a second-source website analytics tool, the main things to consider are:

- Will it disrupt or interfere with the existing website analytics tool
- Is the tracking script for the second website analytics tool lightweight so as not to add load times to the website
- Does it provide the critical data you need to act as a backup for your existing website analytics tool
- How much time will it add to your existing workflows

Ease of use and learning curve are also crucial factors. If you’re using GA4, you might not love the complicated UI and endless settings and options you must navigate. You want an intuitive and user-friendly tool with clear documentation that empowers your team to hit the ground running.

Remember to factor in pricing and affordability as well. While some analytics tools offer free plans or open-source solutions, others might have a hefty price tag. Weigh your budget against the potential ROI of each tool to find the sweet spot that aligns with your business goals and resources.

Finally, consider the support and resources available for your chosen tool. Look for platforms with user communities, documentation, and responsive support teams.
