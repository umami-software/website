# API

Umami allows you to pull data directly by calling the API endpoints.
The endpoints are available at `http://<your-umami>/api`.
All data is returned as JSON.

Any operation you can do through the application is available in the API.

The API logic is split into 5 primary domains.

- [Authentication](authentication)
- [Users](users-api)
- [Teams](teams-api)
- [Websites](websites-api)
