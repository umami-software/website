# API

Umami allows you to pull data directly by calling the API endpoints.
The endpoints are available at `http://<your-umami>/api`.
All data is returned as JSON.

Any operation you can do through the Umami admin panel is available in the API, but it might not yet be documented.

## Authentication

## `POST /api/auth/login`

First you need to get a _token_ in order to make API requests. You need to make a
`POST` request to the `/api/auth/login` endpoint with the following data:

```json
{
  "username": "your-username",
  "password": "your-password"
}
```

If successful you should get a response like the following:

```json
{
  "token": "eyTMjU2IiwiY...4Q0JDLUhWxnIjoiUE_A"
}
```

Save the token value and send an `Authorization` header with all your data requests with the value `Bearer <token>`. Your request header should look something like this:

```http request
Authorization: Bearer eyTMjU2IiwiY...4Q0JDLUhWxnIjoiUE_A
```

For example, with `curl` it would look like this:

```sh
curl https://yoursever/api/websites
   -H "Accept: application/json"
   -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

Prior to v1.26.0, Umami used cookies. If using an older version, you would do the following instead:

Save the token value and pass it as a _cookie_ with all your data requests.
The cookie name is `umami.auth`. Your request header should look something like this:

```http request
Cookie: umami.auth=eyTMjU2IiwiY...4Q0JDLUhWxnIjoiUE_A
```

## Websites

Operations around Websites that Umami is tracking.

## `POST /api/websites`

Creates a website.

**Parameters**

- `domain`: (string) The full domain of the tracked website
- `name`: (string) The name of the website in Umami
- `enable_share_url`: (boolean) Enables a public URL for the stats for this Website
- `public`: (boolean) false by default

**Sample response**

```json
{
  "id": 4,
  "websiteUuid": "51f73213-3f01-4343-a135-25496a3ffd31",
  "userId": 2,
  "name": "Umami",
  "domain": "umami.is",
  "shareId": "8PWex1pa",
  "createdAt": "2021-07-26T17:17:52.846Z"
}
```

## `GET /api/websites`

Returns all tracked websites.

**Parameters**

None

**Sample response**

```json
[
  {
    "id": 4,
    "websiteUuid": "51f73213-3f01-4343-a135-25496a3ffd31",
    "userId": 2,
    "name": "Umami",
    "domain": "umami.is",
    "shareId": "8PWex1pa",
    "createdAt": "2021-07-26T17:17:52.846Z"
  }
]
```

Prior to v1.39 some fields had a different name. If using an old version, use `website_id` instead of `id`, and rewrite the other fields in snake case (for example `share_id` instead of `shareId`).

## Getting stats

There are several endpoints your can call to get stats for your website. All the
stats endpoints require sending a `GET` request with the `Bearer <token>` (post v1.26.0) or `umami.auth` authentication cookie.

## `GET /api/websites/{websiteUuid}/stats`

Gets summarized website statistics.

**Query Parameters**

- `start_at`: Timestamp (in ms) of starting date
- `end_at`: Timestamp (in ms) of end date

**Sample example**

GET (with Authorization header) from url: `https://umami.mydomain.com/api/websites/86d4095c-a2a8-4fc8-9521-103e858e2b41/stats?start_at=1656679719687&end_at=1656766119687`

```json

```json
[
  { "x": "/", "y": 46 },
  { "x": "/docs", "y": 17 },
  { "x": "/download", "y": 14 }
]
```

## Sending stats

## `POST /api/collect`

To register a `pageview` or `event`, you need to send a `POST` to `/api/collect` with
the following data:

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "website": "your-website-id",
    "url": "/",
    "referrer": "",
    "hostname": "your-hostname",
    "language": "en-US",
    "screen": "1920x1080"
  },
  "type": "pageview"
}
```

For events, from v1.37 onwards, you would send:

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "website": "your-website-id",
    "url": "/",
    "event_name": "click-signup-button",
    "hostname": "your-hostname",
    "language": "en-US",
    "screen": "1920x1080"
  },
  "type": "event"
}
```

Prior to v1.37, the `event_name` was separated into two different fields: `event_type` and `event_value`:

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "website": "your-website-id",
    "url": "/",
    "event_type": "click",
    "event_value": "signup-button",
    "hostname": "your-hostname",
    "language": "en-US",
    "screen": "1920x1080"
  },
  "type": "event"
}
```

Note, for `/api/collect` requests you do not need to send an
authentication token.

Also, you need to send a proper `User-Agent` HTTP header or
your request won't be registered.
