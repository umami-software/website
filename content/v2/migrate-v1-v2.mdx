# Migrating v1 to v2

Umami v2 introduces a redesigned schema and a number of breaking changes.

## Breaking changes

- The API endpoints have changed including new ones being added. See [API](/docs/api) for more information.
- The tracker script has been renamed to `script.js` from `umami.js`.
- The collect api endpoint has been renamed to `/api/send` from `/api/collect`.
- The tracker no longer uses CSS class names to trigger events. It now uses HTML data attributes. See [Track events](/docs/track-events) for more information.
- The methods on the global `umami` Javascript object have changed. There is now a single `.track()` method and a new way to send event data.
See [Tracker functions](/docs/tracker-functions) for more information.

## Data migration

Due to the schema changes, your data in your v1 database needs to be converted into v2.
To assist with the migration we created a script `@umami/migrate-v1-v2` that will migrate all of your data for you.

### Requirements

- Database schema must be in sync with the latest v1 Umami repo. The script will query the prisma migrations table to ensure the latest migrations have been ran.

### Important
- Backup your target database prior to use. Potential data loss may occur if the migration is interrupted.
- For users with larger datasets (5M+), the migration may take while. Please plan accordingly.
- The script will NOT migrate any event data into v2.
- The script will ask you if you want to drop your v1 tables after the migration is complete.
- If an `event_data` table is found populated with data, it will be renamed to `v1_event_data` but not dropped.

### Troubleshooting

- If your `DATABASE_URL` is localhost and the migration can't connect to the database, try changing to an IP address, for example: `127.0.0.1`.

## Running migration

There are two ways to run the migration script.

### 1. Running inside the Umami folder

Make sure your application is already built. If not run `yarn build` first.

```shell
cd umami
npx @umami/migrate-v1-v2@latest
```

### 2. Running standalone

### Install

```shell
git clone https://github.com/umami-software/migrate-v1-v2.git
cd migrate-v1-v2
yarn install
yarn build
```

### Configure

Create an `.env` file with the following variable defined:

```
DATABASE_URL={connection url}
```

### Run

```shell
yarn start
```

## Docker migration

Go into your running docker container. You can find the name by the output of `docker ps`.

```shell
docker exec -ti -u 0 <app container name> sh
```

Run the migration script

```shell
npx @umami/migrate-v1-v2@latest
```

When the migration is run successfully, it should like this:
