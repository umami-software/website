# Track events

Besides pageviews, Umami is also able to track events that occur on your website. There are two ways to record
events in Umami, using the **data attributes** property or using **JavaScript**.

## Using data attributes

To enable events, simply add a special data property to the element you want to track.

For example, you might have a button with the following code:

```html
<button id="signup-button">Sign up</button>
```

Add a data property with the following format:

```text
data-umami-event="{event-name}"
```

So your button element would now look like this:

```html
<button id="signup-button" data-umami-event="Signup button">Sign up</button>
```

When the user clicks on this button, Umami will record an event named `Signup button`.

You can optionally pass along **event_data** with the **data-umami-event-\*** annotation.

```text
data-umami-event="Signup button"
data-umami-event-email="bob@aol.com"
data-umami-event-id="123"
```

The additional properties will result in `{ email: 'bob@aol.com', id: '123' }` being recorded with the `Signup button` name.

Event data cannot be sent without an event name.

### Notes

- All event data will be saved as a string using this method. If you want to save event data as numeric, dates, booleans, etc. use the JavaScript method below.
- Other event listeners inside the element will not be triggered.

## Using JavaScript

You can also record events manually using the `window.umami` object. To accomplish the same thing as the above
data-\* method, you can do:

```js
const button = document.getElementById('signup-button');

button.onclick = () => umami.track('Signup button');
```

In this case, Umami will record an event named `Signup button`.

If you want to record dynamic data, see [Tracker functions](/docs/tracker-functions).

## View events

Once your events are recorded, they will be available on your website **Events** page.

## View event properties

Your custom data can be accessed under the **Properties** tab on the **Events** page.
This section will show you all the custom data properties you saved as well as a breakdown of all the values.

## Prevent tracking yourself

To prevent tracking yourself, add the key `umami.disabled` to your browser's local storage. Set the value to `1`.
