title: Tracker configuration
---

The Umami tracker provides several properties that allow you to configure its behavior.

### data-host-url

By default, Umami will send data to wherever the script is located. You can override this to send data
to another location.

Usage:

```html
<script
  defer
  src="http://mywebsite.com/script.js"
  data-website-id="94db1cb1-74f4-4a40-ad6c-962362670409"
  data-host-url="http://stats.mywebsite.com"
></script>
```

### data-auto-track

By default, Umami tracks all pageviews and events for you automatically. You can disable this behavior and
track events yourself using the [tracker functions](/docs/tracker-functions).

Usage:

```html
<script
  defer
  src="http://mywebsite.com/script.js"
  data-website-id="94db1cb1-74f4-4a40-ad6c-962362670409"
  data-auto-track="false"
></script>
```

### data-domains

If you want the tracker to only run on specific domains, you can add them to your tracker script. This is a comma delimited list of domain names. Helps if you are working in a staging/development environment.

Usage:

```html
<script
  defer
  src="http://mywebsite.com/script.js"
  data-website-id="94db1cb1-74f4-4a40-ad6c-962362670409"
  data-domains="mywebsite.com,mywebsite2.com"
></script>
```

### data-tag

If you want the tracker to collect events under a specific tag. Events can be filtered in the dashboard by a specific tag.

Usage:

```html
<script
  defer
  src="http://mywebsite.com/script.js"
  data-website-id="94db1cb1-74f4-4a40-ad6c-962362670409"
  data-tag="umami-eu"
></script>
```

### Google Tag Manager

Google Tag Manager will strip the attributes from the tracker, so you can bypass this by using the format below.

Usage:

```html
<script>
  (function () {
    var el = document.createElement('script');
    el.setAttribute('src', 'http://mywebsite.com/script.js');
    el.setAttribute('data-website-id', '94db1cb1-74f4-4a40-ad6c-962362670409');
    document.body.appendChild(el);
  })();
</script>
```
