# Tracker configuration

The Umami tracker provides several properties that allow you to configure its behavior.

### data-host-url

By default, Umami will send data to wherever the script is located. You can override this to send data
to another location.

Usage:
```
<script async defer
  src="http://mywebsite.com/umami.js"
  data-website-id="94db1cb1-74f4-4a40-ad6c-962362670409"
  data-host-url="http://stats.mywebsite.com"
></script>
```

### data-auto-track

By default, Umami tracks all pageviews and events for you automatically. You can disable this behavior and
track events yourself using the [tracker functions](/docs/tracker-functions).

Usage:
```
<script async defer
  src="http://mywebsite.com/umami.js"
  data-website-id="94db1cb1-74f4-4a40-ad6c-962362670409"
  data-auto-track="false"
></script>
```

### data-do-not-track

You can configure Umami to respect the visitor's **Do Not Track** setting. 


Usage:
```
<script async defer
  src="http://mywebsite.com/umami.js"
  data-website-id="94db1cb1-74f4-4a40-ad6c-962362670409"
  data-do-not-track="true"
></script>
```

### data-cache

If you get a lot of pageviews from the same user, for example in a forum website, you can cache some data to 
improve the performance of the tracking script.

*Note: This will use session storage so you may need to inform your users.*

Usage:
```
<script async defer
  src="http://mywebsite.com/umami.js"
  data-website-id="94db1cb1-74f4-4a40-ad6c-962362670409"
  data-cache="true"
></script>
```

### data-domains

If you want the tracker to only run on specific domains, you can add them to your tracker script. This is a comma delimited list of domain names. Helps if you are working in a staging/development environment.

Usage:
```
<script async defer
  src="http://mywebsite.com/umami.js"
  data-website-id="94db1cb1-74f4-4a40-ad6c-962362670409"
  data-domains="mywebsite.com,mywebsite2.com"
></script>
```
