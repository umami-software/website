# Running on Heroku

> [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps. The platform is elegant, flexible, and easy to use, offering developers the simplest path to getting their apps to market.

Heroku provides a free hosting service which works with Umami as well as databases through add-ons.
You don't need to have a database set up before this setup guide.
