# Running on Fly.io

[Fly.io](https://fly.io) turns containers into VMs that can be deployed in one or multiple regions. The `fly launch` process can automatically set up Postgres VM that in connection with your Umami app.

## Setup using Umami's pre-built container

For anyone wishing to deploy Umami on Fly now, here's a simple method using [Umami's pre-built container for postgres](https://github.com/umami-software/umami/pkgs/container/umami/123905077?tag=postgresql-latest) instead of pulling the source and modifying the Dockerfile.

If you don't already have `flyctl` installed, [install it](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/).

1. In a new directory for your app, create `fly.toml`:

```toml
kill_signal = "SIGINT"
kill_timeout = "5s"

[experimental]
auto_rollback = true

[build]
image = "ghcr.io/umami-software/umami:postgresql-latest"

[env]
HOSTNAME = "0.0.0.0"

[[services]]
protocol = "tcp"
internal_port = 3000
processes = ["app"]

[[services.ports]]
port = 80
handlers = ["http"]
force_https = true

[[services.ports]]
port = 443
handlers = ["tls", "http"]

[services.concurrency]
type = "connections"
hard_limit = 25
soft_limit = 20

[[services.tcp_checks]]
interval = "15s"
timeout = "2s"
grace_period = "1s"
```

2. `fly launch` and choose to create an app with the found `fly.toml` configuration.
3. Go through the launch steps, and choose `y` on the step to create a connected Postgres app.
4. Choose not to deploy the app yet.
5. `fly secrets set HASH_SALT="<any-string-minus-angle-brackets>"`, using whatever string you want to salt the hash.
6. `fly deploy` There will be errors, but let the deployment complete.
7. `fly scale memory 512` (or higher, if needed. Umami seems to fail with less than 512 MB RAM)
8. `fly deploy`
9. Following the [Umami docs](https://umami.is/docs/login), log in with user: `admin` and password: `umami`

Adjust instance locations, number of machines, auto-scaling, custom domains for your Umami app, and any other Fly.io options as per Fly [docs](https://fly.io/docs/)
