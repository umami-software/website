title: Running on Netlify
---

[Netlify](https://netlify.com/) provides a free hosting service which is ideal for GitHub organizations.

In this setup, you should already have a database server running and accepting remote connections. If you don't already have a
database, you can follow the [Running on DigitalOcean](/docs/running-on-digitalocean) guide to get a database up and running. You
can also check out the **Managed databases** section under [Hosting](/docs/guides/hosting).
