In this release of Umami, we are introducing batch processing, payload overrides, a do not track feature and more!

## Features

### Batch send

You can now send data in batches, for example when trying to import a lot of data through the API. Instead of sending a single payload object, you would send an array of objects. It will be processed by the same logic from `/api/send`. To use this feature, you would make a `POST` request to `/api/batch`.

### Payload overrides

When you send a request to `/api/send`, Umami pulls data from the request such as user-agent and IP address. Now you can provide your own values in the payload. This is useful when you're sending from a server or mobile environment where you are not using a web browser. The values you can provide are:

- **ip**: IP address. Note that when you send a custom IP address, the normal geo headers from hosts like Vercel and Cloudflare are ignored and a local lookup will be made to get the country and city data.
- **userAgent**: User agent string. Note this must be in a valid format or your request might be flagged as a bot.
- **timestamp**: UNIX timestamp in seconds. If passed in, Umami will record the data with the given timestamp instead of the current time.

### Do Not Track

You can respect users DNT setting by adding the parameter `data-do-not-track=true` on your tracker script.
