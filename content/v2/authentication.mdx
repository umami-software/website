# Authentication

## `POST /api/auth/login`

First you need to get a _token_ in order to make API requests. You need to make a
`POST` request to the `/api/auth/login` endpoint with the following data:

```json
{
  "username": "your-username",
  "password": "your-password"
}
```

If successful you should get a response like the following:

```json
{
  "token": "eyTMjU2IiwiY...4Q0JDLUhWxnIjoiUE_A",
  "user": {
    "id": "cd33a605-d785-42a1-9365-d6cad3b7befd",
    "username": "your-username",
    "createdAt": "2020-04-20 01:00:00"
  }
}
```

Save the token value and send an `Authorization` header with all your data requests with the value `Bearer <token>`. Your request header should look something like this:

```http request
Authorization: Bearer eyTMjU2IiwiY...4Q0JDLUhWxnIjoiUE_A
```

For example, with `curl` it would look like this:

```shell
curl https://{yoursever}/api/websites
   -H "Accept: application/json"
   -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

The authorization token is expected with every API call that requires permissions.

## `POST /api/auth/verify`

You can verify if the token is still valid.

**Sample response**

```
{
    id: "41e2b680-648e-4b09-bcd7-3e2b10c06264",
    username: "umami"
    role: "admin",
    isAdmin: true,
}
```
