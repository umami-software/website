# Running on Forge

[Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/) is a paid server management services, tailored to hosting Laravel apps on Server Providers like DigitalOcean,
Linode, Vultr, Amazon, Hetzner and more.

If you have a Forge Account and a connected server bucket, you can easily set up an Umami installation.

## Prerequisites

1. Configure the (sub) domain you would like to have Umami available on. Usually, you do this by configuring you DNS config with an A-Record that points to your bucket IP-Address.

## Setup

1. Select your desired Server in Forge.
2. Go to **Sites** > **New Site**
   - Enter the domain name
   - Project Type: Static HTML
   - Check **Create Database**, enter a Database Name
   - Click **Add**
3. To install the Repository, fork the [https://github.com/umami-software/umami](https://github.com/umami-software/umami) project to your GitHub account or install from the official repository.
   - Enter the Repository path: `umami-software/umami`
   - Uncheck **Install Composer Dependencies**
   - Click **Install Repository**
4. Update the deployment script and add the following after the `git pull origin $FORGE_SITE_BRANCH` command.

   ```sh
   yarn install
   yarn build
   ```

   Remove these lines, since we don't have artisan or use php:

   ```
   ( flock -w 10 9 || exit 1
   echo 'Restarting FPM...'; sudo -S service $FORGE_PHP_FPM reload ) 9>/tmp/fpmlock

   if [ -f artisan ]; then
       $FORGE_PHP artisan migrate --force
   fi
   ```

5. In Forge, go to your Server page, click **Database** and add a user to the just created database.
6. Create the database-connection string and add it to your `.env` file:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/dbname
   ```

7. Perform the initial project setup, via SSH:

   ```sh
   yarn install
   yarn update-db
   yarn build
   ```

8. Go to your Umami-Site and click on **SSL** in the left menu and add an SSL-Certificate.
9. Click **Edit files** > **Edit Nginx Configuration** and add the following before the favicon.

   ```
   location / {
       proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
       proxy_http_version 1.1;
       proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
       proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
       proxy_set_header Host $host;
       proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
   }
   ```

   This configuration will route the traffic to the node-server that Umami runs on.

10. In Forge, go to your Server page, click **Daemons** and add **New Daemon** to keep the Umami Node-Server up and running.
    - Command: `yarn start`
    - Directory: `/home/forge/umami.yourdomain.tld`
    - Click **Create**

You should now be able to reach your Umami project.
