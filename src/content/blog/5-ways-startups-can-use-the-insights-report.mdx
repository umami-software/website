The Breakdown report allows you to slice into your website and app analytics via advanced filtering. Filtering options include URL, Page title, Referrer, Query, Browser, OS, Device, Region, City, and Host. The Breakdown report will then take that sub-set of data and break it down by views, Visits, Visitors, Bounce rate, and Visit duration. The magic with the Breakdown report is that you can use multiple filters to really get a granular look at things. The Breakdown report enables founders and product teams to uncover hidden patterns, identify key trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve performance.

Let's explore five practical ways startups can use the Umami Breakdown report to drive growth and optimize their user experience.

## Breakdown Report Primer

Before diving into specific use cases, let's briefly cover how to use the Breakdown report:

1. In your Umami dashboard, navigate to the Reports section and create a new Breakdown report (the Breakdown report comes standard with all versions of Umami).
2. Select your website and date range.
3. Select the fields you want to analyze (e.g., URL, Page title, Referrer, OS, Device, Country).
4. Run the report

For detailed instructions on setting up and using the Breakdown report, please refer to our [documentation](https://umami.is/docs/reports/report-breakdown).

Now, let's explore five ways startups can use the Breakdown report to drive growth and make data-driven decisions.

## Content Performance Analysis

For startups focused on content marketing or those with content-rich products, the Breakdown report can provide data on which content resonates most with users.

Use the URL or Page title field to segment your data by content type or specific pages. Apply filters to focus on high-value metrics like time on page, bounce rate, or page views or queries (which can capture UTM parameters in URLs) related to content engagement (e.g., "share article" or "download resource").

For example, you might discover that your how-to guides have a significantly lower bounce rate and higher average time on page compared to your company news articles. This insight could inform your content strategy, prompting you to create more practical, actionable content that keeps users engaged.

## User Segmentation and Behavior Analysis

The Breakdown report's segmentation capabilities make it ideal for analyzing how different user groups interact with your product.

Combine fields like Device, OS, and Country to create specific user segments. Then, analyze how these segments differ in terms of engagement metrics, feature usage, or conversion rates.

You might find that mobile users from a particular country have a much higher conversion rate for a specific feature. This insight could lead you to optimize your mobile experience for that market or create targeted marketing campaigns to capitalize on this high-performing segment.

## Acquisition Channel Optimization

For startups focused on growth, understanding which acquisition channels are most effective is crucial. The Breakdown report can help you dig deeper into your traffic sources and their quality.

Use the Referrer field to segment your data by traffic source. Combine this with metrics like bounce rate, pages per session, and conversion events to assess the quality of traffic from each source.

You might discover that while a particular social media platform drives a high volume of traffic, the visitors from that source have a high bounce rate and low conversion rate. Conversely, you might find that organic search traffic, while lower in volume, has a much higher engagement and conversion rate. These insights can help you allocate your marketing resources more effectively.

## Feature Adoption and Usage Patterns

For product-led startups, understanding how users interact with different features is crucial for product development and user experience optimization.

Analyze the URLs or Page Titles of key features within your product, then use the Breakdown report to analyze how different user segments interact with these features. You can segment by device, geography, or any other relevant dimension.

For instance, you might find that Android users heavily use a collaboration feature, while iOS users rarely touch it. This insight could inform your product roadmap, prompting you to develop more collaborative tools for Android users or to create educational content to boost adoption among iOS users.

## User Journey and Funnel Analysis

While Umami offers dedicated [Funnel](https://umami.is/blog/optimizing-conversion-paths-using-the-funnel-report) and [Journey](https://umami.is/blog/perfect-your-understanding-of-user-journeys) reports, the Breakdown report can provide additional depth to your understanding of user paths through your product.

Use the URL field to analyze the most common paths users take through your site or product. Apply filters to focus on high-value journeys, such as those that lead to conversions or key feature usage.

You might discover that users who visit your pricing page directly after your features page have a higher likelihood of signing up for a trial. This insight could prompt you to optimize the path between these pages or to add more prominent calls-to-action on the features page to guide users toward pricing information.
