You can reveal your key by clicking on the `visible` icon in the text input.

## Using your key

You can access your Umami Cloud data by querying the following address.

`https://api.umami.is/v1`

Just pass in your API key via a custom header `x-umami-api-key`

For example, with `curl` it would look like this:

```sh
curl https://api.umami.is/v1/websites
   -H "Accept: application/json"
   -H "x-umami-api-key <api-key>"
```

## Using your key with API Client

Set the following requirement variables to have the API client use your API key.

```
UMAMI_API_KEY={Your API key}
UMAMI_API_CLIENT_ENDPOINT=https://api.umami.is/v1
```

More details on using the API client can be found in [API client](/docs/api-client).

## Limits

Each API key is limited to 50 calls every 15 seconds.

## Not Allowed

The following API routes are not made available using your API key.

```
/me/password
/users
/users/*
```

## Deleting your key

You can delete your key under `Accounts` > `API Keys`, and clicking the `Delete` button for the specific key to be deleted.

Once an API key is deleted, it cannot be recovered.
